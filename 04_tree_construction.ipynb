    "In the previous notebook, we discussed how to use multi-level multipole expansion to calculate the potential field at target points, when the sources and targets are well separated. So in this notebook, we will think about how to build a hierarchical tree to store the particles in order to achieve a multi-level multipole expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1986, Barnes and Hut observed that the particles might work in the same way that humans interact with neighboring individuals, more distant villages and larger countries. They came up with an algorithm that the potential on an individual particle from other particles close by is evaluated by direct summation (particle-particle interaction), whereas the potential due to more distant particles is calculated by multipole expansion (particle-cluster interaction). To apply this algorithm, they proposed a tree structure to group the particles in a smart way to facilitate the tree algorithm. Let's follow their idea to construct a tree of particles!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we demonstrate the idea with a 2d quadtree where each cell can be subdivided into $4$ child cells. We begin with a **root** cell which is big enough to contain all the particles in space. We follow several rules to build this quadtree:\n",
    "* If there is more than one particles in the cell, we need to split this **parent** cell into 4 **child** cells.\n",
    "* If there is only one particle in the cell, which means this cell cannot be split, then we call this a **leaf** cell.\n",
    "* If there is no particles in a cell, we can ignore the cell (do not store the cell in memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"image/division_tree.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above illustrates the recursive procedure to build a quadtree based on these rules. In this example, we use the number \"1\" to determine whether the cell needs to be split. We call this number a critical number $n_{crit}$, which implies the maximum number of particles that a **leaf** cell can contain. If a cell accommodates more than $n_{crit}$ number of particles, it has to be split and is no longer a leaf cell. This parameter tells about the granularity of the problem, which has a tremendous effect on the efficiency of treecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's start to define the problem and our rules to build the tree. Consider there are $n=100$ particles randomly scatterd in the domain $x$, $y$, $z$ $\\in$ $\\left[ 0, 1 \\right]$, each of them is a source and target. To contain all the particles, we define a **root** cubic cell centered at $(0.5,0.5, 0.5)$ with a side length of $1$. For a cubic cell, the radius is the half of side length, thus the root cell's radius $r_r$ is $0.5$. Then we choose $n_{crit}=10$ as the threshold to split a cell."

    "Assuming that we create the root cell, then we add the particles into this root cell. After we put the 10th particle into the root, $n_{crit} = 10$ for the root. If there is a 11th particle coming, we have to split the root cell. So what is the first step if you want to do a split? The answer is to create a new cell instance which is the child of the root cell in the cells list. Thus \"adding a child\" is the dependency of \"splitting a cell\". Now let's think about how to add a child.\n",
    "\n",

Don't forget the 8-bit binary marker \"nchild\". Since the new child is at $5th$ octant, the fifth digit from the right should be changed from \"0\" to \"1\".

    "Eventually, we build the hierarchical octree based on the random particle distribution and our rule that $n_{crit}=10$. By constructing the tree, we put all the cells in a single list, and for each cell element, we can tell its geometry/location parameter ($x_c$, $y_c$, $z_c$, $r$). In addition, we know every parent-child relationship according to the mutual reference, and we know which particles are located in which cell. After we build the tree, we can find there are altogther two types of the cell:\n",
